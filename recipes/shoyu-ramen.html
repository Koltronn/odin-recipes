    <h2>Grab the perfect amount of noodles and a scoop of this umami savory broth and you will be traveling to Tokyo in no time!</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh ramen noodles</li>
        <li>Sesame oil</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Cooking sake</li>
        <li>Dashi</li>
        <li>Mirin</li>
        <li>Menma</li>
        <li>Dry nori sheets</li>
        <li>Chopped scallion</li>
        <li>Ground white pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all of your kitchen tools and ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>Next, add my broth flavoring elements: soy sauce, sake, dashi, etc. Once it’s boiling, lower the heat, cover and simmer for about 15 minutes or so.</li>
        <li>In a separate pot, boil your noodles according to the instructions on the package—but make sure to reserve a bit of your noodle water. Don’t throw all of it out! We’re going to add a cup of the noodle water to our shoyu soup base. Why? The noodle water is going to cut our concentrated soup base down to a perfect strength. Added bonus, it’s already piping hot and carrying some of the essence of the alkaline ramen noodles we just cooked.</li>
        <li>Now, if you like your noodles on the al dente side, pull them off the heat a minute before you think they’ll be perfectly cooked. Much like spaghetti, they’ll keep cooking a bit after being taken out of the boiling water. Plus, we’re putting them back into hot soup before serving.</li>
        <li>Now, divide your noodles into two bowls, add your soup and toppings and slurp away on your delicious homemade shoyu ramen!
        </li>
    </ol>
