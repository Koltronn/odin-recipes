    <h2>You haven't had tempura at its best until you've had it freshly fried. This simple batter is totally worth deep frying in your home kitchen. We love serving them with a punchy, garlicky mayo for dipping, but all you really need is a squeeze of lemon.</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Red bell pepper</li>
        <li>Yellow onion</li>
        <li>Broccoli</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Cornstarch</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Seltzer</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Hot sauce</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large, heavy-bottomed pot 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. Heat oil over medium heat until a candy thermometer reads 375Â°. 
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make tempura batter: in a large bowl, whisk to combine flour and cornstarch. Measure beer or seltzer into a liquid measuring cup, then stir in egg. Add liquid ingredients to dry ingredients and stir until just combined. (Some pockets of dry flour are OK!)</li>
        <li>Add chopped vegetables and toss to coat. Transfer coated vegetables to the hot oil 2 to 3 pieces at a time, allowing excess batter to drip off before lowering into oil.</li>
        <li>Fry, turning frequently, until vegetables are lightly golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove to a paper-towel lined plate and season with salt immediately. Continue frying in batches until all vegetables are cooked.</li>
        <li>For sauce: in a small bowl, whisk together mayo, hot sauce, and garlic. Serve with tempura vegetables.
        </li>
    </ol>
